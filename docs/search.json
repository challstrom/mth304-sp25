Learning takes effort, a willingness to try something that may not work, and an openness to learning from feedback. My role is to help create an environment in which all of you are supported in these aspects.\nI want you to feel comfortable coming to me with any questions or concerns that arise, mathematical and otherwise. If you encounter any issues that interfere with your learning, whether they are physical, mental, emotional, economic, or otherwise, or if you experience discrimination or mistreatment of any sort, please contact me immediately.",

    "text": "Technology and Other Resources\nSome of the work we will do in this class will benefit from the use of technology such as Desmos. I highly recommend that you create a (free) Desmos account so that you can save your work. If you have questions about how to use any of these tools, please let me know. If you do use technology in your work, please indicate this in your written solutions.\n\nA word on search engines\nSearch engines (e.g. Google) use algorithms to determine what content on the internet is likely to be relevant to your search query. They cannot find information that is not on the internet, and search results may be affected by hidden parameters introduced by the companies that run them. Whether this content actually is relevant (or correct) is up to you to figure out.\n\n\nA word on GenAI\nAI text generators (ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini, etc.) use Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce text that is likely to resemble a human-produced response to a given prompt. They are most likely to produce a meaningful output on topics where a great deal of human-produced text has already been written (which happens to include most of undergraduate mathematics). This output, however, is based on statistical predictions from contextual clues, not logical deductions or expert knowledge and there’s no guarantee that it’s mathematically correct!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy general feeling about the use of AI tools in the context of this course is that they fundamentally get in the way of your learning in several ways and should not be used in any capacity.\n\n\n\n\nThey are prone to both plagiarizing as well as making things up. Since their responses are produced from an amalgamation of many sources (sometimes without the permission of the original authors) they invariably use definitions, notation, assumptions, and concepts that we have not introduced in our class.\nAI tools undermine the collaborative learning community that we would like to develop. A significant way in which we will be building understanding in the class is through discussion with each other.\nUsing AI tools means that you are cheating yourself out of an opportunity to learn. The whole point of being in this class is to learn how to use certain ideas and tools to solve problems. Note that I didn’t say that the point is to solve problems. This is a very much like the difference between going to a restaurant vs. learning how to cook.\nUsing AI tools undermines the relationship between student and instructor. When a student gives me work that seems AI generated, it creates an adversarial dynamic and now I’m looking at everything that student gives me with suspicion. If you ever feel tempted to use AI tools to shortcut your learning, please pause and come talk to me about finding a different strategy.\nApart from doing mathematics, students sometimes use AI tools to help with writing (and here I’m also thinking of tools like Grammerly). Here’s a secret – AI-assisted writing is not good writing, period. It might be gramatically “correct” but that’s not the same thing. Good writing involves actual thinking by a unique individual person.\n\nSo where does that leave us? I really do not want to lay down a policy of “THOU SHALL NOT…” because I’d much rather simply trust you. So that’s what I’ll do - you now know how I feel about using AI tools in this class and I will trust that you will respect me, your classmates, and our goals for being here together enough that you’ll honor that trust.",

    "text": "We will use a method of instruction sometimes called Inquiry Based Learning (IBL) which is designed to engage and foster skills and habits that working mathematicians use regularly; you will be asked to solve problems, make conjectures, experiment, explore, create, collaborate, and communicate your work with your peers. Rather than giving you facts to memorize or showing you clear paths to solutions, my role is to guide you via a sequence of carefully chosen problems through a journey of mathematical discovery.\nThroughout the semester, I will give you lists of definitions to interpret and make sense of, as well as a sequence of Tasks which you and your classmates will complete. These tasks are carefully chosen to build up your understanding of the course material. There will be very little traditional lecture. Instead, class time will consist largely of student presentations of new material. For best results, you should come to class prepared to share your work or ideas about that day’s problems. This method of inquiry does not work very well if you’re looking at a problem for the first time in class.\nI will ask you to share your solutions in class regularly, typically in smaller groups. You are encouraged to critique the problems (reformulating them if needed), to generate examples and counterexamples to theorems or conjectures, to formulate new theorems based on what you’ve learned, and to prove or disprove these conjectures. When observing another student’s presentation, it is your responsibility to follow their argument closely and decide if they have seems reasonable. If you cannot follow their logic, or have questions about their solution, it is your responsibility to ask!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA key feature of the IBL method is student discovery and for that reason outside resources are not allowed. This means that you should not consult texts (other than the one handed out in class), the internet, students not currently enrolled in the course, or faculty other than myself. Consulting outside resources will only deprive yourself of opportunities to engage with the material authentically.\nYou are encouraged to work with your classmates on the problems, but for best results you should get as far as you can on your own before collaborating. It’s important that you do not feel overwhelmed – so please let me know if you’re stuck on a problem and I’ll be happy to give you hints.",

Indeed, the study of complex variables opens up whole new avenues of research in a huge array of topics including algebraic geometry, analytic number theory, dynamical systems, signal analysis, and fluid mechanics just to name a few.\nSpecific topics that we’ll cover in this course include\n\nRepresentations of complex numbers\nFundamental complex-valued functions\nTopology and limits in the complex plane\nDerivatives and holomorphic functions\nSeries and analyticity\nContour integrals\nCauchy-Goursat theorem\nCauchy integral formula\nResidue theorem\n\nIn addition to these specific mathematical topics, our learning goals also include:\n\ncommunicating mathematics effectively\ndeveloping strategies for solving challenging, multi-step problems\ndeveloping a practice of self-reflection on one’s own learning.\n\nCertain affective traits (i.e., dispositions and habits that are useful for all learners, regardless of topic) are also valued, such as persistence and growth mindset, and the development of these qualities will be fostered by the course.",

In many cases, it’s an opportunity to refine or fill in any gaps of solutions that came up in class. In other cases, it gives you a chance to extend or apply ideas from class to new problem. Finally, homework is a place to practice communicating your understanding to others. Your goal in completing the homework is not just to find a solution, but to convince your reader that your solution is reasonable.\nHomework is an opportunity to be challenged, make mistakes, struggle productively, and learn how to proceed in the face of uncertainty.

You can tell that you’ve done this adequately if you can read what you’ve written aloud - verbatim - and it makes sense.\nDon’t rely on symbols and notations alone, use words to explain how you’re getting from one step to the next.\nThink about who your audience is and include an appropriate amount of detail. Your reader should be convinced that your solution is correct without having to fill in any missing steps.\nRespect your reader. This means that your solution should clear, easy to read, and free of spelling and grammatical errors, even if the mathematical steps are correct. Don’t ask them to put in more work than necessary to understand your solution!\nYou should first work out the solutions on scratch paper and then neatly write up your solutions. Do not hand in your scratch paper.",

If your paper has been torn out of a spiral notebook, remove the fringes.\nWriting should be neat, legible, and not too small. If your handwriting is not up to the task, you might consider using a typesetting enviornment such as LaTeX or Typst. I can help you get started with these tools.\nInclude your name, the date, the class and section number, and the name of the assignment.\nProblems should be clearly labeled and numbered on the left side of the paper. Leave a visible separation between problems. Write the problems in order.\nBegin your solution with the original problem statement (or a paraphrasing of such). Do not assume that your reader has the problem statement in front of them.\nUse whitespace on the margins and between problems to make your solutions easier to read. Leave room in the margins for comments.\nIf you worked with other students on a problem, acknowledge their contributions.\nIf you used technology on a problem, acknowledge where and how.\nAssignments submitted electronically should be submitted as a single PDF file. If scanned, make sure your images are clear and not cropped. Take care that pages are in the correct order and are rotated to the proper orientation. File names should include some identifying information such as your last name and what assignment this is (imagine this file in a folder with submissions from other students).",

    "text": "9.1 Academic Integrity\nThe University of Portland is a diverse academic community of learners and scholars who are dedicated to freely sharing ideas and engaging in respectful discussion of those ideas to discover truth. Such pursuits require each person, whether student or faculty, to present truthfully our own ideas and give credit to others for the ideas that they generate. Thus, cheating on exams, copying another student’s assignment, including homework, or using the work of others without proper citation are some examples of violating academic integrity.\nEspecially for written and oral assignments, students have an ethical responsibility to properly cite the authors of any books, articles, or other sources that they use. Students should expect to submit assignments to Turnitin, a database that ensures assignments are original work of the student submitting. Each discipline has guidelines for how to give appropriate credit, and instructors will communicate the specific guidelines for their discipline. The Clark Library also maintains a webpage that provides citation guidelines at libguides.up.edu/cite.\nThe misuse of AI to shortcut course learning outcomes will be treated as a violation of academic integrity comparable to plagiarism or cheating. Faculty are responsible for including a written “Course AI Policy” in their syllabi that clearly states what they consider appropriate and inappropriate uses of AI in the context of their courses. Students are responsible for using AI in ways that do not detract from the established learning outcomes of the course. All members of the scholarly community are responsible for demonstrating sound judgment in discerning when and how to utilize AI in their work, upholding standards of citation, originality, and integrity.",

If you have an AES Accommodation Plan, you should meet with your instructor to discuss how to implement your plan in this class. Requests for alternate location for exams and/or extended exam time should, where possible, be made two weeks in advance of an exam, and must be made at least one week in advance of an exam. Also, if applicable, you should meet with your instructor to discuss emergency medical information or how best to ensure your safe evacuation from the building in case of fire or other emergency. All information that students provide regarding disability or accommodation is confidential. All students are responsible for completing the required coursework and are held to the same evaluation standards specified in the course syllabus.",
